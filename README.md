SDP SCP for Directories
-----------------------
-----------------------

## Install for ZSH users
  * Copy the sdp $fpath
  * Make the function native to shell
	
	```
	   source ~/.zshrc
	   autoload sdp
	```

## Example
   ``` 
      sdp <Filename> <Destination Address>
   ```

## Idea behind the function
   > Tar the directory and then do ssh to host and untar it there.
